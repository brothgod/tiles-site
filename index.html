    <p style="text-align: center">An experimentation using Wang tiles</p>
    <p>
      Computing has become a medium for creating generative artwork because of
      its ability to mathematically provide a balance of randomness and
      predictability. The ease of generative art lies in its potential to
      construct infinite iterations of a design all with a single algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile">Wang tiles</a>
      were first proposed by mathematician Hao Wang through a model of square
      like shapes that could be placed side by side to create a an infinite
      plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my Wang tile algorithm, I created my own set of 16 tiles that can be
      configured using a set of constraints to construct an iterative pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      These 16 tiles were curated with the following parameters: 1 that is an
      unconnected shape, 4 connecting to just 1 side, 4 connecting to 2 adjacent
      sides, 2 connect to 2 opposite sides, 4 connecting to 3 sides, and 1
      connecting to all 4 sides.
    </p>

    <p>
      After following this basic sketch, the tiles were constructed one by one
      using a series of ellipses, rectangles, and curves to create the following
      set of tiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      From there, the rest of the 10 tiles came from simply rotating tiles 1, 3,
      5, and 7.
